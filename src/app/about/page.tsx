              The Beginning
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              SpeakWithSophie.ai was born from one simple idea: real fluency
              comes from real conversation, not memorization. Traditional
              language learning tools often trap learners in lists of words and
              isolated grammar drills — but we knew there had to be a better
              way.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              At Sophie.ai, we believe the fastest path to confidence in another
              language is daily speaking practice with intelligent feedback that
              feels natural and human-like. Sophie isn&apos;t just an AI —
              she&apos;s a speaking partner that listens, adapts, and helps you
              practice real-world conversations from day one.

              through meaningful interaction.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">

              We Luis Alberto Olguin Reyes and Ernesto Olguin Roman shape this
              platform with the belief that anyone should be able to speak
              confidently in a new language — without fear, without judgment,
              and without boring drills. We built Sophie.ai to empower learners
              everywhere to speak boldly, speak often, and speak naturally.
